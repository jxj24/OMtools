It should also be removed for evaluating	fixation: @ 0¡ in one plane while the eyes are displaced in the other plane; or	if the eyes are diagonally displaced. Evaluation of fixation at a displaced gaze	angle while the eyes are at 0¡ in the other plane does not require crosstalk	removal if the data are from EyeLink. To REMOVE CROSSTALK from EyeLink or Ober data:	Use RE data from file #1 to determine the + & - vert (for rh) and		+ & - hor (for rv) scale factors	Use LE data from file #2 to determine the + & - vert (for lh) and		+ & - hor (for lv) scale factors		NOTE: scale factors are AVERAGE values during STEADY fixation			They are, (av. shift during off-zero fix)/(off-zero ampl.)				(e.g., +v = ±horshift/+vfixpt; -v = ±horshift/-vfixpt)	Place scale factors (with appropriate sign) in 'adjbias.txt'		(e.g.,"% Crosstalk Scale Factors: +rv=_; -rv=_; +rh=_; -rh=_;			+lv=_; -lv=_; +lh=_; -lh=_")	Use 'crosstalk' with 2 scale factors for each channel		(±rv for rh; ±rh for rv; ±lv for lh; and ±lh for lv)PLOT and LABEL data using 'plt(h,v,t,hv,hvt,hvh,hvth)'   [It contains,      t=maket(rh);      plot(t,rh,'c',t,lh,'y--',...)      text(maxt,maxpt,'REH') etc.      title(namelist)      ept      dragger]   Use dragger to align traces and labelsOTHER available utilities are:   gtext, textedit, linedit, axisedit, killobj,   posedit, draw, rotplot (help in contents.txt)To CREATE a VELOCITY array use 'rhv=d2pt(rh);'PRINT figure with 'print', 'print -dps[c]', 'print -dljet3'      zoomtool figure with 'print -noui'To PLOT SUBARRAYS, use             'plot(sub(t,startime,interval),sub(rh,startime,interval),'c')'   or define the subarrays first and then plot.
