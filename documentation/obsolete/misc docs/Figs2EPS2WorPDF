Drag filename.eps into PPTFor OS X <10.3;6. Use "PS2PDF Print Optimized" to convert EPS file to PDF file	(In Utilities/PS2PDF and Friends/PS to PDF folder)For OS X >10.3;6. Drag .eps file onto Preview and crop	(To find where Preview saved the pdf, CMD-click on name in preview window)SIMULINK Block Diagrams:1. From model window: "CMD A"; "CMD C"2. In Word doc: "CMD V"		** If that does not print clearly **1. Start MATLAB in Classic2. Bring up block diagram in SIMULINK3. "cd2" to Desktop (OS X)4. Verify that printer is selected in chooser5. "simprintdlg('-crossplatform')"6. Check: Send to File;	SAVE: name to desktop (gives only top level of model e.g., testbed)7. Bring desired window (block diagram) to front8. "CMD P" ("print") TO: file on Desktop	Give filename (puts filename.ps on Desktop)8a. Drag filename.eps to PPT9.
