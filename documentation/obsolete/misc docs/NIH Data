TO PREPARE TENOTOMY (NIH) FILES FOR MATLAB1. Copy files from CD into proper folders on HD	a) In Control Panel:Memory, Turn off virtual memory (if it was on-OS 8.6); restart Mac2. For coil data files:	Use 'biasgen' to create adjbias.txt (choose r for adjbias.rcl or c for adjbias.lin or		i for adjbias.ext)   [initials? b(h,v)#####_, name? #####, comments? filedate, records? 8,   		r (i), b (a), 20, 200, {(I)nterleaved or (C)ontigulus? C}, 6 (3)(4), st,rh,lh,sv,rv,lv   		(st,rh,lh)(rh,lh,rv,lv)]   For Ober data files:	Use the 'adjbias.skel' file in 'Ober' folder and alter as necessary for each data folder3. With BBEdit memory set to 60Mb, rename files #####_(8-1) to n####_(8-1); edit to remove		ll 1-14 (or for Ober files,ll 1-4 and remove data in Marker col*);		save (Cmd-S, Cmd-W) (can load files 1-7 simultaneously into BBEdit)		*There is a BBEdit Replace Macro called 'NIH OberMkrStrp' = '   O[0-9][0-9]*$'		NOTE: Data files must be BBEdit files with Type=text (Use Snitch in OS 9.2.2) 	a) Set MatLab memory to 100Mb for larger files	b) Restore virtual memory (OS 8.6); restart Mac4. For coil data files:	MatLab n#####_(8-1) files; use 'clear all; rdnih ('b' is default) [or 'rdnih('h')' or	'rdnih('v')'], sample at 200Hz, SAVE AS BINARY h,v, or b#####_(8-1)_200.bin (b####_(8-1)	done automatically)	NOTE: 'rdnih' runs too slowly; boot up in OS 9.2.2 and things run 10x faster! (OS X.2)   For Ober data files:	MatLab n(v)#####_(1-4,8)(5,6) files; use 'clear all; rdnih or rdnihobr ('b' is default) [or	'rdnihobr('v')'], sample at 300Hz, SAVE AS BINARY b(v)#####_(1-4,8)(5,6)_300.bin	(b(v)#####_(1-4,8)(5,6) done automatically)5. Edit adjbias.xxx' files with BBEdit; Find and Replace All '.bin (.txt)' with '_200.bin (.txt)'		or '_300.bin (.txt)'save as 'Mac','BBEdit' or save and Get Info -> Batch on adjbias.txt		and change Creator to BBEdit; Update Changed Info6. Return MatLab memory to 40Mb and BBEdit to 20MbTO LOAD DATA MANUALLY (Unusual coil data or Ober data)1. Use 'load2'2. lh=filename(:,2);	[all rows of col 2]	(lv=.....(:,3);)3. rh=filename(:,4);	[all rows of col 4]	(rv=.....(:,5);)4. a=[lh lv rh rv];			[4 cols of data]	(a=[sv rv lv];)5. size(a)For ASCII or BINARY files from Ober data:6. save filename_freq.txt a -ascii	or   fid = fopen(filename_freq.bin, 'w', 'l');	fwrite(fid, a, 'float');	fclose(fid);For ASCII or BINARY files from coil data:6. b=a(1:5:val of size(a),:);	[decimate coil data by factor of 5]7. size(b)				[should be 1/5th of size(a)]8. save filename_200.txt b -ascii	[where the 200=1/5 of 1000]	or   fid = fopen(filename_200.bin, 'w', 'l');	fwrite(fid, b, 'float');	fclose(fid);FOR SINCORRECTED CALIBRATION (ROBINSON COIL) [NIH]1. Use 'biasgen' to make adjbias file for rcoil (or copy adjbias.rcl to adjbias.txt)2. Use 'rd' to load the rh or lh monoc cal data3. Plot rh or lh ['plot(rh)'] and 'hold on' 'plot(st,'r')'4. Use 'zoomtool' to determine offset & the scale factor @ CALPOINT (positive-negative/2)	If S does not fixate targets in one direction, use the other for the 20deg cal factor	If S does not fixate any targets, set 'Inf' to '20' in adjbias file5. Copy the 2 values (1 offset & 1 scale factor) from "4" into adjbias.txt (+/- adjbias.rcl)      [Do this for both rh and lh]      FOR EXTENDED CALIBRATION (Ober Data)1. Copy adjbias.ext to adjbias.txt2. Use 'rd' to load the rh or lh monoc cal data3. Use 'pickdata' to pick rh or lh4. Use 'os' ('cal') to determine ofset and 5 pairs of scale factors (0, ±5, ±10, ±15, ±20, ±25¡)5. Copy the 11 values (1 offset & 10 scale factors) from "4" into adjbias.txt (& adjbias.ext)      [Do this for both rh and lh]FOR LINEAR CALIBRATION (Ober Data - if unable to use Extended Calibration) [NH]1. Copy adjbias.lin to adjbias.txt2. Use 'rd' to load the rh or lh monoc cal data3. Use 'pickdata' to pick rh or lh4. Use 'os' ('cal') to determine offset5. Copy the offset from "4" into adjbias.txt (& adjbias.lin)      [Do this for both rh and lh]DATA ANALYSIS [For ALL Subjects' Pre- and Post-Op records]1. Print out each calibrated file using 'plth' +/- 'pltv'	For the long 8th record, add plot of '(rhv/50) +/- bias-shift'2. Plot 15-sec intervals at 3-4 gaze angles for records 4 and 53. Examine each file for problems* and for waveforms and fixating eye in BEVW files	Note on hardcopy the fixating eye(s) for each record to be analyzed using the NAFX	* shifts in attention, fixation point or eye; blinks; uncharacteristic waveform	changes; etc.4. Using zoomtool for gaze angle of interest, determine offset, interval, and FWIN position	boundaries to be used for the NAFX evaluation (mark on printout)5. Filter data for NAFX using LPF @ 15 Hz with 4th-order rolloff (including vel array)	Copy info from Matlab into appropriate BBEdit file6. Define sub arrays from marked printout and apply 'nff/showpv' to determine correct	# of fp's in interval - start at 4deg/sec and increase as necessary	S1-S5:	Use 'nffnih.m' [e.g., 'nffnih(posubary,velsubary,splfreq,[poslim,vellim],'showpv',0/1);'	and 'nffnih(posubary,velubary,splfreq,#fovs,'naf(p)(v)',[tauIn,posLim,velLim]);'	where, #fovs = (#fps detected, including extras + #cy w/o fp)]	S6-S15:	Use 'nff.m' [e.g., 'nff(posubary,velsubary,splfreq,[poslim,vellim],'showpv',0/1);'	and 'nff(posubary,velubary,splfreq,#fovs,'naf(p)(v)',[tauIn,posLim,velLim]);'	where, #fovs = #cy]7.
