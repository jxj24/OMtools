                                   NAFXTheory:=======The NAFX and its predecessor, the NAF, originated from the NFF which attempted to relate the time-intervals of fp's and their position and velocity SD's to a measure of the 'quality' of a CN waveform (i.e., how lilely it was to allow good acuity).  When calculated by hand, each cycle was assumed to have 1 fp and the # of cycles in the interval of interest was included in the calculation.  Later, when the NAF(X) was automated, only 'true' fp's (i.e., those that satisfied the foveation-window (FWIN) criteria) were used in the calculation.  For waveforms that exhibited well-developed foveation, this changed nothing.  However, for poor foveation due to excessive jitter or high velocities, many cycles were deemed to have no fp's and the resulting NAF(X) reflected only those few fp's detected.  This yielded NAF(X) values that were not likely to be well correlated with acuity.  To overcome this shortcomming, a measure of the total number of potential fp's (or cycles) needed to be reintroduced.  That was most easily accomplished by applying the NAF(X) as described below. Method and Criteria (2005):===========================Much of the repetitive work in the previous methodology has been automated by 'nafxprep' used in conjunction with the graphical interface for NAFX1. Filter data using, 'r/lh=lpf(r/lh,4,20,samp_freq)'	NOTE: Since the nafx function needs rh or lh, we can no longer use	rhf or lhf for filtered data.2. Run 'nafx'3. Use 'zoomtool' on the filtered data to be analyzed.4. Home in on the segment you wish to analyze.5. Place the cursors at the start and end of the subarray you wish to use.6. Click on the C1 (xy) and C2 (xy) buttons.7. Place the cursors at the highest and lowest peaks* of the foveation periods.8. Click on the C1 (xy) and C2 (xy) buttons.	NOTE: Step 8 may be omitted as 'nafxprep' will automatically read the	cursor positions.9. Run 'nafxprep' in the command window.10. All subarrays and bias shifts will be created and entered into the NAFX graphic interface.11. Choose a foveation position window that encompasses the cursors' Y interval.12. Run the Foveation Period calculation ('showpv') and verify that all foveation periods were counted.13. If any cycles were missed, increase the velocity window until all are counted or you reach 10 deg/sec.14. Run the NAFX calculation using #fovs as defined below.**15. Copy all relevant commands from the command window to a BBEdit file.16. Run 'xaxshift(nafx_start)' on the Figure to be printed and print it.* You could use the horizontal cursor lines to straddle the foveation positions if you stay within the start and stop points.** If 'showpv' detects >=1fp/cy, use the number of CYCLES as the #fovs         i.e., "#fovs" = #cy's  (#fps - #extra fps detected)   If 'showpv' misses any cycles (i.e., no fp detected) choose the pos limit of   FWIN just large enough to encompass all fp's in the interval to be used   (1 fp per cycle)   Then choose the LOWEST vel limit of FWIN (velLim) that allows 'showpv' to   detect 1fp/cy or, increase the velocity limit to the LOWEST value that   MAXIMIZES the # of fp's detected and use         "#fovs" = #cy's + #cy w/o fp or joined cycles within a fp         		(#cy's = #fps - #extra fps detected) NOTE:The output of the NAFX to the command window of Matlab includes all the necessary data information and explicit NAFX command lines to reproduce the analysis easily. They should be copied and kept in a text file which can be used for this purpose at a latter date without loading the data or using zoomtool to define the interval and extent of the foveation positions. All that need be done is to copy the appropriate command lines (those starting with "È") from the text file to the command window. An example from NAFX version 1.0 is shown below. Use 'help nafx' for information regarding the NAFX command lines.Text File Data:  Èrhf=lpf(rh,4,20,500);Èrhfv=d2pt(rhf,3,500);Èrhf02=sub(rhf,0.02,1.8);	Èrhfv02=sub(rhfv,0.02,1.8);	Èrhf02=rhf02-0.5685;Ènafx(rhf02,rhfv02,500,[2.5,4],'showpv',1);Total time that meets position criterion = 1168 msec.
